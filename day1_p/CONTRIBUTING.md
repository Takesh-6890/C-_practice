## Coding style

- This project uses an `.editorconfig` file with standard C# conventions:
  - 4 spaces for indentation
  - UTF-8 encoding
  - CRLF line endings
  - Keep `using` directives organized with `System` namespaces first
  - Prefer explicit types for built-in types (avoid `var` for `int`, `string`, etc.) except when the type is obvious

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] Code builds successfully
- [ ] No unnecessary files or binaries committed
- [ ] Add/update unit tests if applicable
- [ ] Ensure code follows the conventions in `.editorconfig`
